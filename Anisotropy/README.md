# Anisotropy plugin
## Purpose
Typing stiffness component for anisotropic materials is real pain, specially when taking into account symmetries (like crystal symmetries). 
Therefore, this plugin aims to automatically compute the relationships between stiffness compenents, taking into account the crystal symmetries. These relationships are provided by [Nye, 1959]
