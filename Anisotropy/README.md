# Anisotropy plugin
## Purpose
Typing stiffness components for anisotropic materials is real pain, specially when taking into account symmetries (like crystal symmetries). 
Therefore, this plugin aims to automatically take account for relationships between stiffness compenents, depending on the crystal symmetries. These relationships are provided by [Nye, 1959].
